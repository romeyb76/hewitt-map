City of Hewitt

Neighborhood Map Project created by React for the Udacity FEND Final Project.

This is to view places in the city of Hewitt, a suburb of Waco, TX, USA.

Project was created using the following APIs:

google-maps-api react-foursquare react-axios @material-ui/core

The code itself is based on each perspective APIs documentation along with the training I received from Udacity coach, Doug Brown, my fellow classmates on the Udacity Slack channels, and assistance from watching the coding walkthroughs by Ryan Waite, Yahya Elharony, and kenjournal. 

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
